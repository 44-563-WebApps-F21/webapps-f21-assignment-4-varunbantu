    <h3>ACT III The Hall at Hunstanton Chase.</h3>
    <span> SCENE--</span> <span class="a"> LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C. LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a sofa_.
        GERALD _in a chair_..
    </span>
    <p class="char1">LORD ILLINGWORTH.<br>
        <span class="speech"> Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald. I
            knew she would come round in the end.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="char2">GERALD.<br>
        <span class="speech"> My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
            she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary. She is
            perfectly right, too. I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
            couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="char1">LORD ILLINGWORTH.<br>
        <span class="speech">My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
            whatsoever. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
            not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="char2">GERALD.<br>
        <span class="speech">But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="char1">LORD ILLINGWORTH.<br>
        <span class="speech"> Don’t be afraid, Gerald. Remember that you’ve got on
            your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth! There is nothing
            like youth. The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life. The old are in
            life’s lumber-room. But youth is the Lord of Life. Youth has a kingdom
            waiting for it. Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
            like most kings. To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
            wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
            the community.<p id="stagedirection">[GERALD _shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother_.
                _Enter_ LADY CAROLINE.]</p>
        </span>
    </p>

    <p class="char2">GERALD.<br>
        <span class="speech">But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="char1">LORD ILLINGWORTH.<br> I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="char2">GERALD.<br> I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="char1">LORD ILLINGWORTH.<br> So Lady Hunstanton told me.
        </span>
