        <h3>ACT III The Hall at Hunstanton Chase.</h3>
        <span> SCENE--</span> <span class="a"> LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C. LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a sofa_.
            GERALD _in a chair_..
        </span>
        <p>
        <h4 class="char1">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h4>
        <span class="speech"> Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald. I
            knew she would come round in the end.
        </span>
        </p>
        <h4 class="char2">GERALD.</h4>
        <span class="speech"> My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
            she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary. She is
            perfectly right, too. I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
            couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.
        </span>
    
        <p>
        <h4 class="char1">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h4>
        <span class="speech">My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
            whatsoever. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
            not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.
