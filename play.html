        <p>ACT III : <h3>_The Hall at Hunstanton Chase_.</h3></p>
        <p style="white-space: pre">
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I
            knew she would come round in the end.
            GERALD.  My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
            she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is
            perfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
            couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
            whatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
            not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.
            GERALD.  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on
            your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing
            like youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in
            life’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom
            waiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
            like most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
            wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
            the community.
            GERALD.  But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.
            GERALD.  I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.
            LORD ILLINGWORTH.  So Lady Hunstanton told me.
